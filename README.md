# zen_lines_nft

### For our project we decided to write smart contracts for an NFT. I provided the artwork and music for the NFT.

### I uploaded the file using IPFS Desktop, to host a node on my computer directly. We used the URI it gave us to input into the app when it called for it.

### I then created a gallery meant to hold the NFT and any future NFT that we may want to hold there.

### Once combined with the other smart contracts we now had a fucntioning streamlit app connected to a gallery smart contract.
