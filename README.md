# zen_lines_nft

### For our project we decided to write smart contracts for an NFT. I provided the artwork, a hand drawn icon, and music, created by my co-producer and I, for the NFT.
#### Example here:

### I uploaded the file using IPFS Desktop, though the IPFS CLI could also achieve the same result. We used the URI from IPFS and input it into some aspects of the smart contracts, as well as the streamlit app itself.

### I then wrote a smart contract that would function like a gallery, meant to hold the NFT as well as any future NFT drop.

### Once combined with the other smart contracts and the streamlit code, we now had a functioning streamlit app connected to a smart contract that serves as a gallery.

### In short it allows for a user to input a wallet address and a token URI to store the artwork in the gallery and even get appraisal information.
