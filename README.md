# zen_lines_nft

### For our project we decided to write smart contracts for an NFT. I provided the artwork and music for the NFT.

### I uploaded the file using IPFS Desktop, to host a node on my computer directly. We used the URI it gave us to input into the app when it called for it.

### I then created a gallery meant to hold the NFT as well as any future NFT.

### Once combined with the other smart contracts as well as the web application code we now had a functioning streamlit app connected to a smart contract that serves as a gallery.

### In short it allows for a user to input a wallet address and a token URI to store the artwork in the gallery and even get appraisal information.
