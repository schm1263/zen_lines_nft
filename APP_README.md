## **App creation:**
<p>Two apps were created for this project:</p>
<p>- nft_app.py  - This app creates the TokenID of the music and image creation.</p>
<p>- app.py  - This app allows to register our musical piece and image to be stored in a Gallery. It also has the functionality to record and modify appraisals for the musc and image piece.</p>
